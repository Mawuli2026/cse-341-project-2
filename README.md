# OAuth Authentication
This project uses Google OAuth 2.0 with Passport.js:

GET /auth/google â€“ start login

GET /auth/google/callback â€“ redirect after login

GET /auth/logout â€“ destroy session

After login, you can access protected routes like:

POST /api/items

DELETE /api/users/:id



# API Endpoints
# ðŸ”¹ Items Routes: 
GET = /api/items    
POST = /api/items   
PUT = /api/items:id    
DELETE = /api/items:id 


# ðŸ”¹ Users Routes
GET = /api/users = Get all users
POST = /api/users = create new user
PUT = /api/users:id = Update user
DELETE = /api/users:id = Delete user


 # Data Validation
# Validation is done manually in middleware:

Item requires:

name (string)

price (number)

User requires:

username (string)

email (valid email format)


# Security
OAuth login is managed through passport-google-oauth20

Sessions are handled with express-session

Protected routes return 401 Unauthorized if user is not authenticated
